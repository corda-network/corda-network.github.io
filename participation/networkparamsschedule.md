Network Parameter Updates
=========================


Addition of new and updates to existing parameters
-------------------------------------------------------------

Network parameters specify things like Minimum Platform Version and whitelisted notaries which, although not expected to change frequently, nevertheless will need to be updated over time. [Our docs site](https://docs.corda.net/network-map.html#network-parameters) has more detail.

The network parameter upgrade schedule for 2020 can be found on our [StatusPage](https://cordanetwork.statuspage.io).

_The following are to be provided by participants:

_If participants wish to change any network parameters, including a new public notary, they must give notice to the Operator (cordanetwork.ops@r3.com) *20 business days* in advance of the scheduled Network Parameter window, or else they will have to wait for the next window.

_If they have contracts for whitelisting, this must be provided no later than the Monday preceding the change window at 1200 UTC.
