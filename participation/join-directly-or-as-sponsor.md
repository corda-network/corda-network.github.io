# Join Directly or as a Sponsor

Most legal entities join Corda Network as **Direct Participants** – meaning they sign the Terms of Use with the Foundation (governing behaviour of nodes), take responsibility for paying any of the Network’s low billing costs, and interact with the Foundation (via its appointed Network Operator) for support and questions.

There is also an option to join as an **Intergroup Sponsoring Participant** if you intend to have multiple legal entities within your organisation to join the network, which means you take on responsibility for their nodes’ behaviour on the network (but their onboarding process will be completely controlled by you) and look after all billing and identity checks for them.
