Membership Tiers
----------------
Participation in Corda Network is for legal entities only. In general, the term 'participation' rather than 'membership' 
is used, as this is the terminology used for a Dutch Stichting in the laws governing it.

Currently there are two tiers for participation in Corda Network:
(1) Full participant
(2) Identity-only / sponsored participant

A **full participant** usually signs an agreement directly with the Corda Network Foundation. They typically manage their 
own nodes and are part of one or several tightly-knit business network(s). They receive full on-boarding support from 
the Network Operator, can be a member of multiple business networks and run multiple applications, have voting rights 
and can stand for the Foundation's board of directors.  

In contrast, **identity-only participants** typically are part of much larger, disparate business networks where 
participants only infrequently transact on Corda Network. They only need an identity for one application; receive 
on-boarding support from their business network or application provider, instead of the Network Operator; 
do not have voting rights and cannot stand for the Foundation's board of directors. They are issued with a certificate 
by the network identity issuance service, they will be on the network map, 
and a lower level of identity checking will have been done, given that they are part of a sponsored model.

Transaction Fees
----------------
Transaction fees are charged for notarisation provided by Corda Network notary, and are structured in two different 
models. Both apply on a per-identity basis:

## Model 1. Pay As You Go
This is invoiced retrospectively at the end of the year. As with participation fees, the invoice is managed by Sponsors 
for identity-only participants, and sent direct to full members.

Number of transactions per year   | Cost $      
----------------------------------|-------------
0 – 10K                           | FREE        
10 - 20K                          | 10c per txn 
20K +                             | 1c per txn  

## Model 2. Up-front Package
This is designed to provide assurance over notarisation costs. It is invoiced prospectively at the start of the year. 
As with participation fees, the invoice is managed by Sponsors for identity-only participants, and sent direct to full 
members. 

Number of transactions per year    | Cost $ 
-----------------------------------|--------
0 - 50K                            | $1,000 
50 - 100K                          | $800   
100K +  (in 50k increments)        | $500   

Any 'unused' transactions at the year-end are not carried forwards or reimbursed. Additional transaction 
packages can be purchased at any time, but previous purchases that year are ignored in calculating the cost.

## Third-party Notaries
Notary fees for third-party notaries are at the sole discretion of the corresponding notary provider, and invoicing is 
managed by them.
