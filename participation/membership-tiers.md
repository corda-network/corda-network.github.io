Pricing
=======

1.Annual Participation (Membership) Fee
------------------------------------

In general, the term 'participation' rather than 'membership' is used, as this is the terminology used for a Dutch Stichting in the laws governing it. At present, participation in Corda Network is for legal entities only. 


**Participation Certificate**
* Receives full onboarding support onto Corda Network from the Network Operator
* Can be a member of multiple business networks and run multiple business applications
* Has voting rights for how the Foundation is governed
* Can stand for the Foundation's Board of Directors

Pricing: Free until December 2021



2.Transaction Fees
------------------

Transaction fees are charged for notarisation provided by [Corda Network notary](https://corda.network/participation/notary-considerations.html), and are structured in two different models. 

Both apply on a per-identity basis:

**Model 1. Pay As You Go**

This is invoiced retrospectively at the end of the year. As with participation fees, the invoice is managed by Sponsors 
for identity-only participants, and sent direct to full members.

Number of transactions per year   | Cost $      
----------------------------------|-------------
0 – 10K                           | FREE        
10 - 20K                          | 10c per txn 
20K +                             | 1c per txn  

**Model 2. Up-front Package**

This is designed to provide assurance over notarisation costs. It is invoiced prospectively at the start of the year. 
As with participation fees, the invoice is managed by Sponsors for identity-only participants, and sent direct to full 
members. 

Number of transactions per year    | Cost $ 
-----------------------------------|--------
0 - 50K                            | $1,000 
50 - 100K                          | $800   
100K +  (in 50k increments)        | $500   

Any 'unused' transactions at the year-end are not carried forwards or reimbursed. Additional transaction 
packages can be purchased at any time, but previous purchases that year are ignored in calculating the cost.

## Third-party Notaries
Notary fees for third-party notaries are at the sole discretion of the corresponding notary provider, and invoicing is 
managed by them. There are no Corda Network fees for running your own notary. See [Notary Considerations](https://corda.network/participation/notary-considerations.html).
