Governance Event M007
=====================

Approve Segregated Sub-Zone Pricing
===================================

Proposal
--------
Approve pricing for SSZs for 2020 and beyond.

Reason
------
SSZs have a real, ongoing operational cost in terms of setup, management, patching, and monitoring, and one principle of 
Corda Network is participants pay for costs they incur.
The exact cost of operating a SSZ is hard to ascertain, but the cost model for our infrastructure indicates a cost of 
10K per zone.

Impact
------
High. New SSZ operators must be informed of the fee.

Decision
--------
Approved by a vote.
