# Mandatory Governance Event 0007

## Approve Segregated Sub-Zone Pricing

### Proposal

Approve pricing for SSZs for 2020 and beyond.

### Reason

SSZs have a real, ongoing operational cost in terms of setup, management, patching, and monitoring, and one principle of
Corda Network is participants pay for costs they incur.
The exact cost of operating a SSZ is hard to ascertain, but the cost model for our infrastructure indicates a cost of
10K per zone.

### Impact

High. New SSZ operators must be informed of the fee.

### Decision

Approved by a vote.
