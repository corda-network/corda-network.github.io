Advisory Governance Event 0001
==============================

Converge the UAT Network Governance
===================================

Proposal
--------
Converge the UAT Network (or sometimes known as “Pre-Production” Network) to be part of the Corda Network Foundation’s 
overall remit. For more details, please see [https://uat.network.r3.com/](https://uat.network.r3.com/).

Reason
------
Most, if not all, of Corda Network customers will be joining both Pre-Production and Production. 
Bringing both networks under the same remit and governance will make the overall customer on-boarding and ongoing 
experience much smoother, in terms of there being 
* 1 legal agreement.
* 1 streamlined price for both UAT and Production as well as from a billing and data management perspective.

Impact
------
Low.

Decision
--------
Stakeholders in R3 (Product and Production teams as well as Legal and Finance) as well as the Transition Board of the 
Corda Network Foundation are unanimously agreed. The decision has been taken to merge UAT into the remit of Corda 
Network Foundation. The transition is now underway.
