Mandatory Governance Event 0004
===============================

Change X500 name length
===================================

Proposal
--------
Change x500 name length to be 128 characters in total for all 6 fields.

Reason
------
Current bug in our software which won’t be resolved until Corda 4.3.

Impact
------
Low. Most legal entity names joining now don’t have very long names.

Decision
--------
Unanimously approved by a vote.
