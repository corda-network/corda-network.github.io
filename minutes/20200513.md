## Minutes - Transition Board Meeting 6, 13th May 2020

 

### 1. General updates

JC gave an overview of last 3 months; 1) Corda Network has 12 Business Networks live; 2) a new R3 internal project has started, to make network onboarding streamlined and scalable for larger numbers of customers; and 3) team secured Directors and Officer’s Insurance for 2020, for all the Foundation Directors going forward (whilst lowering last year’s price)

 

### 2. Upcoming election – CNF Board 

CQ explained that 14 applications were received for 9 seats, so will need to have a vote on 30th June. Since only 8 of the 14 applicants have live nodes - there may be drop-outs, if 6 of the applying legal entities aren’t live by deadline of 23rd June.

 

Next steps (BC/CQ): Director applications to be circulated to all current Board members, via secure filesharing. Team to finalise voting software, upload applications and communicate process to all eligible voters in the Participant Community, in 1-2 weeks

 

### 3. Proposal around multiple Doormen certs

R3’s Office of the CTO, led by Richard Brown, has developed research report showing its technically possible to issue additional doormen certs off the Trust Root used by the Foundation currently. In its current format, the Foundation would have no, or very limited ability, to revoke the certificate.

 

The Foundation approved an investigation into both 

1) testing this ‘potential offering’ with existing / potential customers 

2) conducting legal analysis (with external counsel) to see what the risks and scope of this are, with an option to vote on this change formally, at our next meeting – aiming to have a final meeting in mid-June (depends on analysis being ready). 

 

AV raised whether there could be a conflict of interest if the new Board Directors might have a vested interest in this happening. However, its noted that only 1/14 Board applications received has been from a candidate who may be interested in this (SDX). In addition, the Board will have an opportunity to vote at a meeting in June on this topic.

 

AI raised whether we could be careful around offering clients a Doormen cert without the Foundation’s ability to revoke This is not something typical in PKI and we should be do detailed research if this is a sound idea. An ideal alternative would be for the Foundation still have the right to revoke the Doorman cert, but only in extremely rare and clearly well-defined circumstances (for legal to help us define). Action: CQ to set up Board meeting in mid-June 

 

### 4. Financials 

AS asked for an overview of cost / revenue projections and if we are on track. CQ to send out in next few days via secure filesharing

 

### 5. Liability

For legals, the Foundation now has a new change control process. All amendments to Corda Network legal agreements are now reviewed by external counsel / whether they are material / immaterial and if material, to escalate to the Foundation Board for approval. This process may not be scalable in the long run, but works currently.

**Escalation Event 1** - 3 requests from customer wishing to join the network on materially changing our standard liability clauses. On each request, the Board asked for additional information from external counsel – otherwise they will take a cautious approach and vote against.

 

### Actions

1. BC to issue all applications to Board by secure file-sharing, this week

2. Team to communicate voting process in next 1 week to Board; to members shortly thereafter

3. CQ/BC to set up Board meeting in mid-June

4. CQ to send financial pack around by secure file-sharing

5. CQ to liaise with external counsel for further info around the three liability clauses, and send to Board, before making a collective final decision on liability
