# About the Foundation 

Corda Network Foundation (the Foundation) is a Dutch not-for-profit entity known as a Stichting, set up to govern Corda Network in December 2018. 

Since April 2021, the purpose of the Foundation is threefold: 

- Safeguard the Corda Network Trust Root – a long-term cryptographic key which all the identity of participants on Corda Network link back to, as their source; 

- Ensure a robust identity structure on Corda Network through policies which flow down to participants through a simple rulebook. 

- Provide discretional guidelines and best practices to would-be participants on the network, to enable interoperability between CorDapps, and support third party service operators (such as notaries) on the network.

Both of these roles help provide participants confidence in the identity of all parties in any transaction on Corda Network. The Foundation’s constitution is defined in a set of Articles of Association and By-laws found on this website.

As of 1 April 2021, a key change is that the Foundation no longer is responsible for the operation of Network Services to participants of Corda Network. Going forward, R3 will operate the Corda Network. The new allocation of roles and responsibilities between the Foundation and R3 is explained below.

The Foundation enables Network participants to be involved with, and also understand, how decisions are made (including around issues of identity and permission), building trust and engagement from a wide range of stakeholders. We believe this will bring about the best decisions and outcomes for the Network’s long-term success.

The Foundation has a governing Board with 11 representatives.
