# About the Foundation 

Corda Network Foundation (the Foundation) is a not-for-profit legal entity known as a Stichting, residing in the Netherlands. The key role of the Foundation is to safeguard the Corda Network Trust Root – a long-term cryptographic key which all the identity of participants on Corda Network links back to, as their source. This provides participants confidence in the identity of all parties in any transaction on Corda Network. Foundation’s constitution is defined in a set of Articles of Association and By-laws found on this website.

As of 1 April 2021, the Foundation no longer delivers Network Services to participants of Corda Network. Going forward, R3 will operate the Corda Network. 

The new allocation of roles and responsibilities between the Foundation and R3 is explained below.

The Foundation enables Network participants to be involved with, and also understand, how decisions are made (including around issues of identity and permission), building trust and engagement from a wide range of stakeholders. We believe this will bring about the best decisions and outcomes for the Network’s long-term success.

The Foundation has a governing Board with 11 representatives.
