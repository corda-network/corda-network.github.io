## Trust Root Generation

The generation of the long-lived trust root for Corda Network required a level of ceremony, witnessing and
memorialisation that was met through a highly-scripted and secure event held at the R3 offices at 2 London Wall,
London, UK on Friday 14th September 2018. The ceremony required extensive preparation, advice and guidance from both
KPMG in 2017 and Schellman in 2018, and included 7 independent witnesses from global banks and R3's partner program. The
total expenditure was more than one year of effort, and significant financial cost, in order to deliver long-term
trust.

The full script for the event and other supporting artifacts are found via the links and attachments at https://trust.corda.network/.

The root key material generated is held in offline secure locations, and the subordinate key material held on production
HSMs.
