## 13 May 2021 - Change Details

#### 1. Admissions Criteria

- Clarification to Section 1.2

Participants that enter into a Sponsored Participant Terms of Use with R3 should not rely on R3’s sanctions screening process with respect to such Sponsored Participants. Such sponsoring Participants are responsible for obtaining further documentation such as articles of incorporation, evidence of ultimate beneficial ownership, and any other evidence needed to verify the identity of Sponsored Participants, and conduct appropriate due diligence **and sanctions** checks (e.g., high risk industry analysis, high risk geographies, negative news checks) to ensure entities meet acceptable risk tolerance standards as required by the applicable Business Network.

#### 2. Revocation

- Clarification of meaning in Section 1.1

<s>"Privilege attributes asserted in the Corda Network Participant’s Participation Certificate are reduced;"</S> replaced with *"If the Participant’s business right to this certificate is no longer valid (for example, a Terms of Use no longer covers this Certificate)"*

- Delete Section 5, as it duplicates the meaning of Section 1.3

<s>"R3 is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Corda Network Participant’s private key to compromise. Methods have been developed that can be clearly demonstrated, based on the public key (such as a Debian weak key, see http://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys)."*</s>
