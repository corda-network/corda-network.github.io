# Allowable Identity Names

## 1. Introduction

Participation Certificates will be issued based on the information provided in the Certificate Signing Request. “Certificate Signing Request” or “CSR” means a request made by a Participant to R3 to digitally sign its Participation Certificate. Any changes to information contained in the Participant Certificate, including updating the legal entity name or contact information, will require the Participation Certificate to be revoked and re-issued by R3. R3 will deal with requests to re-issue Participation Certificates as soon as reasonably practicable. 


## 2. Composition of Node's Legal Name (or X.500 Name)

Each Corda Network Node must have a Corda Network Participation Certificate. Each Corda Network Participation Certificate is identified by its "Legal Name", which consist of legal entity information consistent with that of the Participant. The Legal Name (or X.500 name, as referred below) can contain a maximum of 6 fields that follows X.500 protocol.

1. Organisation (O)
2. Organisation Unit (OU)
3. Locality (L)
4. Country (C)
5. State (ST)
6. Common Name (CN)

The X.500 name must at least contains the following 4 fields:

1. Organisation (O)
2. Organisation Unit (OU)
3. Locality (L)
4. Country (C)

The guidance of naming these 6 fields are explained in greater detail in Section 3 below. Data fields in the X.500 name must be sorted in the order specified in the Corda protocol, namely CN followed by OU, O, L, ST, and C.

An example X.500 name is as follows (*NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REAL X.500 NAME*): If you want to onboard a node for R3 LLC with the following details:

| Field title | Example |
|---------------------------------|---|
| **Organisation (O)**            | R3 LLC  |
| **City (L)**                    | New York  |
| **Country (C)**                 | US  |
| **Organisation Unit (OU)**      | Ops  |
| State (ST)                      | New York  |
| Common Name (CN)                | Notary |
| **Node Operator email address** | info@r3.com|

You should use the following as the node's X.500 name: CN=Notary, OU=Worker, O=R3 LLC, L=New York, ST=New York, C=US. 

The maximum number of characters in the X.500 name (across all 6 fields, including field names, such as "O=", "OU=", "L=") is under **128 characters**.

## 3. Naming X500 Fields for a Node's Legal Name

R3 shall check that all X.500 names meet the following requirements:

- Organisation, Organisational Unit, Locality and Country attributes are present.
- Organisation attribute represents a real legal entity’s name.
- The Country attribute is a valid ISO 3166-1 two letter code in upper-case.
- The X.500 name is unique to all other pre-existing X.500 names on the network (this is a check done during onboarding; the Participant cannot check prior to joining).

Overall, the completion of the fields within the X.500 in an incorrect manner is one of the most common points of error in joining Corda Network, so take care to fill this out correctly. As part of standard onboarding checks for Corda Network, R3 may verify that these details have been accurately populated and reject requests where the population of these fields does not appear to be correct.

For guidance on writing a legal entity name please see the table below:


| Field                      | Mandatory | Length (chars) | Validation                                                                                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------|:---------:|---------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Organisation (O)**       |     Y     |            110 | As per above, and additionally: No double-spacing.  | The 'O' field defines the owning organisation of the Corda Network Participant Certificate. This should be set to the **legal name** of the organisation, as it appears in the official register within the jurisdiction in which the entity is registered/incorporated.

It may be used (for example) to separate Corda Network Nodes used for different purposes by the same Organisation (O).                                                                                 |

*Note that the total maximum length of all 6 fields must remain under 128 characters.*

### 3.1. Selecting the Right Legal Entity for the "O" field in the node’s X.500 name

The name in the ‘O’ field should match the exact name in a recent search of the government registry in which it is registered. This search should be recent and, in any event, not older than 1 year.

If R3 cannot find evidence of the company through either looking in government trade registers or in trusted 3rd party legal entity databases, it reserves the right not to issue the relevant Participation Certificate. Participants may submit evidence of a company’s existence, but it must be recent (as defined above) and from a government trade register. R3 may need to confirm this with its own sources.

**Here are some examples of government trade registers:**

### 3.2. Constraints on Characters and Unicode

The total X.500 name (including field names such as "O=", "OU=", "L=") is required to be under 128 characters.

The free text fields in the X.500 name must obey the following constraints:

1. Consist only of characters from the following Unicode code blocks: Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended A, Latin Extended B
2. Start with upper-case first letter
3. May not contain the null character
4. May not contain control characters
5. Must have at least two characters
6. Must be normalized to Unicode NFKC form
7. May not include the following forbidden characters: , = $ " ' \ /+
8. May not include trailing or leading whitespace
9. Must be encoded using UTF-8


### 3.3. Stopwords

“Stopwords” are character sequences that may be the result of mistaken applications or intent to confuse. Stopwords may not be used in the Organization Unit or Common Name fields of the X.500, unless sufficient justification is provided. R3 may adjust the list of stopwords at any time.

Examples of Stopwords:

1. Corda
2. R3
3. Node
4. Server
5. Oracle
6. Ã
7. Â
8. test (in Production Network)

### 3.4. Node Operator Email Address

Before a Participant Certificate can be sent to a Node seeking to join Corda Network, R3 needs a response from the Node Operator Email Address contained in the CSR (e-mail contained in the node.conf file) to confirm that:
- the email domain used in the node.conf is associated with the legal entity requesting the certificate; and
- the person submitting the CSR has access to the email inbox listed in the node.conf file 

**Requirements for the e-mail address**

The email address used in the node.conf file (the “Node Operator Email Address”) will be used for communications which R3 sends to the Participant, including those involved in identity verification and for all future communication related to Corda Network.
It must be:
- associated with the legal entity submitting the request, and
- be an actively monitored group mailbox such as ‘admin@, ‘info@’ or ‘support’.

Individual email addresses **will not be accepted** for this email address, but can be added as an additional email address for communications, later in the onboarding process.
