# Port Ranges

Outbound connectivity for Corda Network Nodes must support all possible ports allowed by the TCP specification. This does not imply opening all ports on the inbound path â€“ operators of Corda Network Nodes may select a single port for their Corda Network Node and open only that port on network-level firewalls.

We recommend, but do not require, that Corda Network Nodes advertise port 31337 in the Network Map Service.
