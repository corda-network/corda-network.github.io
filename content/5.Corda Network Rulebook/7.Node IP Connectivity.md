# Node IP Connectivity

All nodes in the main zone must advertise at least one IPv4 address.

Corda Network Node peer-to-peer ports must be globally reachable via the internet, from any part of the internet. By implication you may not use TCP/IP firewall rules to block who connects to your Corda Network Node. Instead, access control should be done cryptographically using TLS termination and membership rule checking at the start of flow logic (i.e. before any code other than session setup runs).
