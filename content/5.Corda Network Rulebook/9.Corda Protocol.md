# Corda Protocol 

The “Corda Protocol” is the Corda Software defined by the open source reference implementation.

All Corda Network Participants must ensure their nodes run unmodified Corda or Corda Enterprise software versions as specified in the network parameters' minPlatformVersion field or higher.

Corda Network Nodes may additionally support and use extended versions of the Corda Protocol, however they must not reject traffic from Corda Network Nodes that are using the standard Corda Protocol.

A modification to the open source implementation in incompatible ways will be deemed to have become incompatible with the Corda Protocol and thus in violation of zone policy.
