# Considerations When on Corda Network


## Requesting Re-certification

A CSR may be rejected if the data is not constructed according to the standards set out in *Allowable Identity Names* in this document. Amended CSRs will be subject to the same service levels as new CSRs detailed in the Maintenance and Service Level Handbook.

To request a re-certification for purposes of generating new keys or to amend information on an existing and valid Participation Certificate, Participant must start a new Corda Network Node and request a new Participation Certificate. Such request will be subject to the service levels associated with a new Participation Certificate request. The X.500 name of the new identity must be unique as a combination across all 6 fields (not the same as the previous identity). Details such as the IP address of the node can be changed without re-certification by sending a new configuration file directly to the Network Map Service server.
