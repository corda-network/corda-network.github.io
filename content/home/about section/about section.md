## About Corda Network Foundation

Corda Network enables interoperability – the exchange of data or assets via a secure, efficient internet layer – in a way that isn’t possible with separate Corda networks. A common [Trust Root](/trust-root/index) surrounds all transactions, and a consistent set of network parameters ensures all participants may transact with each other.

The network went live in January 2019, and is governed by an independent, not-for-profit foundation. In Spring 2019, a [transitional board](/governance/board-election) of participants was elected, which will oversee the foundation until democratic elections are held a year later. See the [Governance Guidelines](/governance/governance-guidelines) for more detail.
