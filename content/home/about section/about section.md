## About Corda Network 

Corda Network enables interoperability – the exchange of data or assets via a secure, efficient internet layer – in a way that isn’t possible with separate Corda networks. A common [Trust Root](/trust-root/index) surrounds all transactions, and a consistent set of network parameters ensures all participants may transact with each other.

The network went live in January 2019 and has a vibrant participant community.
