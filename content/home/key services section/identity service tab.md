The Identity Manager controls admissions of participants into Corda Network. The Identity Manager receives certificate signing requests (CSRs) from prospective network participants (sometimes via a business network operator) and reviews the information submitted. A digitally signed participation certificate is returned if:

-   The participant meets the requirements specified in the bylaws and policies of the foundation (broadly speaking, limited to sanction screening only);
-   The participant agrees to Corda Network participant terms of use.

The Corda Network node can then use the participation certificate to register itself with the Network Map.
