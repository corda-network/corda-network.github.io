The Identity Manager controls admissions of participants into Corda Network. The Identity Manager receives certificate signing requests (CSRs) from prospective network participants (sometimes via a business network operator) and reviews the information submitted. A digitally signed participation certificate is returned if:

-   The participant meets the requirements specified in the [Corda Network Rulebook](https://corda.network/corda-network-rulebook/introduction);
-   The participant agrees to Corda Network [Participant Terms of Use](https://corda.network/joining-corda-network/contracting-model).

The Corda Network node can then use the participation certificate to register itself with the Network Map.
