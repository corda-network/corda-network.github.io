# Network Parameter Updates


## Addition of new and updates to existing parameters

Network parameters specify things like Minimum Platform Version and whitelisted notaries which, although not expected to change frequently, nevertheless will need to be updated over time. [Our docs site](https://docs.corda.net/network-map.html#network-parameters) has more detail.

The Network Parameter Update windows can be found on our [StatusPage](https://corda-network.statuspage.io).

*The following are to be provided by participants:*

*If participants wish to change any network parameters, including a new public notary, they must give notice to the Operator (cordanetwork.ops@r3.com) **20 business days** in advance of the scheduled Network Parameter window, or else they will have to wait for the next window.*

*If they have contracts for whitelisting, this must be provided no later than the Monday preceding the change window at 1200 UTC.*
