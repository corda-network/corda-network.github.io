## 1. Introduction and Scope

This Support Handbook contains information on the onboarding and operational support services (“Support”) provided in connection with the Services provided to you (“participant” or “you”) by R3 LLC (“R3”) pursuant to the terms of use (“Terms of Use”) entered into between you and R3. This handbook does not replace or amend in any way the contractual terms and conditions of the Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.

The Support consists of the following in connection with the Services:

1. Corda Network onboarding
2. Operational Support Services when using the Services

## 2. Support Schedule

All time definitions are made in accordance with UTC+0. “Normal Business Hours” are from Sunday 23:00 (GMT) to Friday 23:00 (GMT).

R3’s Support uses a ‘follow-the-sun’ schedule with the Support team based in R3’s offices in the following locations: London, New York and Singapore (each an “Office”).

“Business Day” means any day except (a) a Saturday or a Sunday, (b) any other day on which commercial banking institutions based in the affected Office’s city are authorized or directed by applicable law to close, or (c) any bank holiday in an Office.


## 3. Support Eligibility

Support is only provided for limited Corda Network onboarding assistance and for “Incidents” related to Services – on both the Pre-Production Network and Production Network. “Testnet” is out of scope (other items out of scope are listed in Section 6: Exclusions). Please note that Support does not provide training, consultation or other professional services.

An “Incident” is where the Services do not operate in the manner as set forth in the General Maintenance and SLA Handbook. Determination of whether an “Incident” has occurred (rather than, for example, an issue that arose as a result of a Corda Network Node malfunction/CorDapp problem) shall be made by the Support team in its sole discretion.

R3 is not in control of how a participant’s CorDapp manages workload on its and other CorDapp users’ hardware and operating systems, and so issues of performance or capacity overload caused by the CorDapp’s use of the Services are explicitly excluded from the definition of “Incident” (and are not eligible for Support).

Support is not provided for issues with your CorDapp(s), Corda Network Nodes or environments (other than the Corda Network).

All of the Corda Software requirements set forth herein must be met in order for Support to be provided.

## 3.1 Minimum Platform Version

Participant’s Corda Network Nodes should be running on a Corda Software version at least the same or more recent than the Minimum Platform Version (as defined in the minimum Platform Version among network parameters) of the Pre-Production Network and Production Network.


## 4. Accessing and Onboarding to Support

To resolve an issue or question that you may have in connection with the Corda Network or the Services in the most expedient way possible, the nominated individual should check the Service Dashboard. “Service Dashboard” means a dashboard where Corda Network infrastructure-related changes that impact participants will be communicated by R3, currently located at StatusPage (and which may be moved from time to time), and access to which is provided to participants during their onboarding process.

If the Service Dashboard does not contain information necessary to resolve your issue or question, then you **may raise a ticket through the Support Portal to engage Support.**

## 4.1 Support Portal and Participant Contacts

R3 uses Atlassian Jira Cloud to record all Support tickets and log all investigations. A web portal (“Support Portal”) provides an interface to the Jira Cloud for participants to raise Support tickets. Participant will be provided with a web link to the Support Portal which shall be the primary method for requesting Support.

**1. Requesting first user’s access**

- When onboarding to Corda Network, participants will be required to designate a Corda Network Node operator email address on the node configuration file (“node.conf”). R3’s business operations team will contact the designated email address and ask for one (1) individual that should be granted access to the Support Portal.
- Alternatively, you can request the first user in your organization with access to Support Portal via the following means: If you are a Corda Enterprise customer or have an R3 Account Manager, contact your R3 Account Manager for access. 

**2. Registration Confirmation**

- Once access is granted, the registering individuals) will receive an email which will include a link to sign-up and create a password. R3 does not manage nor record Support Portal passwords outside the Jira Cloud System. If an individual loses their password they should recover access to their account by clicking on the ‘Forgot Password’ link when logging onto the Support Portal.

**3. Raising a Support ticket**

– You may raise a Support ticket via our Support Portal or via email (*note: only emails sent from email addresses with access to the Support Portal will be able to email the Support team*):
- Fill in the online form on the Support Portal (currently found at the following URL: https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7, which may be moved from time to time), specify the Incident Severity (*see Section 5: Incident Classifications and Response Targets for how to determine severity level*) and attach any related documents on the dedicated web link to the Support Portal. 
- Send an email to cordanetworksupport@r3-cev.atlassian.net. All Support tickets raised for “Incidents” are automatically classified as Severity 3 (S3).

**4. Requesting access for different or additional users**

- Access is granted per individual email address basis. If you need to replace the email address originally assigned or request access for one (1) additional individual, a Support ticket for replacement/additional email address(es) will need to be raised.

The designated individual participant contact will be required to have the qualifications set forth in *Section 7: Participant Obligations* below. Support will only be provided to participant contacts. 

## 4.2 Participant Data Stored by R3

Within R3’s Jira Cloud, participant contacts are stored as individuals grouped into organizations.

Only the organization name and data for each participant contact linked to that organization are stored in the Jira Cloud.

For participant contacts, only the full name and email address, as provided by the individual or the person who nominated that individual, are stored in the Jira Cloud. Once the participant contact registers with the Support Portal (accepts the invitation), the email address of that individual is no longer visible on the Jira Service Desk User Interface to the Support team.

Participant should note that, once registered, participant contacts can set up their own Jira profile which includes an avatar graphic and additional information about themselves. This is a feature of the Atlassian Jira Service Desk add-on, not a feature provided by R3. If an individual chooses to customize their profile, the associated data will also be stored in R3’s Jira Cloud. Please note, anything added to this profile is not within R3’s control.

Support tickets and all information added to Support tickets, including attachments, are stored in R3’s Jira Cloud system in perpetuity. Participant should therefore ensure that no personal data is included within such Support tickets or attachments submitted. Participant must request specific deletion of Support ticket(s) if required.


## 4.3 R3 Staff Access to Participant Support Data

In an effort to expedite Support request resolution, the Support team has enabled any member of R3 read-only visibility of all Support tickets raised by all participant contacts including all descriptions and comments on those Support tickets. This is so Support tickets can be quickly brought to the attention of different engineering teams, operations teams or even senior management teams during an investigation. However, only members of the Support team can view and modify user and organization data (e.g., add/delete users and organizations) and only the Support team can administer Support tickets and communicate directly with participant over the Support ticket.


## 5. Incident Classifications and Response Targets 

Incident severity level will first be proposed by participant, provided that R3, in discussion with participant, will make the final determination as to the appropriate severity level in accordance with the following:

For the Production Network, Severity 1-4 may be raised.

For the Pre-Production Network, Severity 2-4 may be raised.

R3 shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to all Incidents as provided below.

## 5.1. Severity 1 Critical

**What is it?**

- Only applicable Service: Notary Service.
- An emergency situation caused by an error in the Corda Network Notary Service which critically impairs a participant’s business.
- Only issues related to Production Network can be raised as Severity 1 Support ticket. E.g.: the Corda Network Notary Service is not responding and participant’s business is critically impaired.
- Fixes are not provided to fix issues with Participant’s Business Network, participants’ individual CorDapps and/or Corda Network Nodes.

**How do we respond to the incident?**

- Acknowledgement: Thirty (30) minutes from the time the incident was reported.
- In addition, R3 shall, at R3's expense, (a) immediately assign an appropriate number of qualified resources to reasonably work towards correction of the Incident 24-hours a day, 7-days a week until R3 has provided a functional workaround or permanent fix or the issue is no longer defined as Severity 1.
- Report status: Regularly report on the status of the corrections if the issue remains after four (4) hours at a schedule agreed with participant.
- An appropriate number of participant resources must be made available in Severity 1 situations and reasonably cooperate to help resolve the issue.

**An incident can be downgraded in the following situations**

1. A functional workaround has been implemented that has enabled the Notary Service to continue normal service;
2. During the course of the investigation it has been determined that the error is not in the Notary Service, as agreed by both parties;
3. Participant/a relevant third party fails to commit resources to work with R3 at any time;
4. Participant confirms the severity can be reduced for other reasons.

## 5.2. Severity 2 Major Impact

**What is it?**

## 7.1 Access to Participant Source Code

To the extent possible, and as requested by R3, participant may also be required to provide R3 or its authorized technical representative access to its source code in order to diagnose an Incident or otherwise provide Support. Participant acknowledges that if access is not provided as requested by R3, response times, Incident determination and Incident resolution may be slower, impaired or impossible.

R3 will treat all source code as confidential and will not share it with anyone outside R3. R3 will also take reasonable steps to only give access to engineers designated to investigate participant’s Incident or provide Support to participant’s source code. R3 will not, under any circumstances, access or take action within participant’s own environments but may provide guidance, advice, or workaround suggestions to participant’s designated support contact who does have such access and rights. After an Incident has been closed, and upon participant’s request, R3 will destroy any copies of uploaded source code and, upon request, will certify to such destruction.

## 7.2 Remedial and Diagnostic Actions Requested by R3

From time to time R3 may request that designated participant contacts and other resources carry out procedures or changes to source or configuration to establish a diagnosis or test a potential fix. These procedures and changes may be destructive in nature or have unexpected adverse effects, and while the Support team will take every reasonable effort to advise of any impact, it is the participant contact’s responsibility to apply due-diligence and ensure they are complying with their organization’s change and backup policies.


## 8. Final disclaimers

R3 is not responsible for any participant Personal Data stored or otherwise used with any of R3’s proprietary software or on any network provided by R3.
