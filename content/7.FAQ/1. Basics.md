## 1. What is Corda Network?

Corda Network is a connected network, using the internet, which enables companies to come together for fast and secure, intermediary-free interactions – while owning their own data via a node (a virtual machine that runs the Corda software and represents a legal entity). These companies can form their own groups (Business Networks) on top of the wider Corda Network, using one or several shared applications (CorDapps). In addition, through Corda Network, any participant can interact with other participants with mutual interests as the need arises, via other CorDapps, due to an ecosystem that is both open yet private thanks to the underlying peer-to-peer design of Corda. 


## 2. What is a Business Network and how is it different from Corda Network?

Business Network is a group of nodes that communicate and transact together using one or more shared CorDapps under a shared [Rulebook](https://corda.network/corda-network-rulebook/introduction/). Corda Network simply provides the underlying infrastructure and services that allows Corda Nodes to transact.

## 3. What is the difference between Corda and Corda Network?

Corda is a permissioned blockchain platform that powers DLT applications; Corda Network is an internet of nodes running on the Corda software.


## 4. What are the key components of any Corda Network?

| **Component**    	| **What it is**                                                                                                      	| **What it does**                                                                         	|
|------------------	|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Trust Root       	| The single, long-term cryptographic key which all network‘s identity (X509) certificates root back to               	| It provides the basis of trust in the provenance of data, recognised by participants     	|
| Identity Manager 	| Admits new members onto the network via granting an identity certificate, based on meeting 3 criteria               	| Performs checks on new certificate requests and grants based on passing the checks       	|
| Network Map      	| A list of IP addresses and legal entity names of each participant on the network, which all participants can access 	| Acts as a Corda Network ‘phone directory’                                                	|
| Notary           	| Node or cluster of notary nodes                                                                                     	| Prevents double spend by verifying uniqueness of the proposed transaction’s input states 	|

## 5. Who governs Corda Network?

Corda Network is governed by the independent [Corda Network Foundation](https://corda.network/corda-network-foundation/about-the-foundation) that is responsible for safeguarding the Trust Root which all Corda Network identities link back to. It also sets policies related to Public Key Infrastructure, which flow down to R3 as the operator of Corda Network and indirectly to all Corda Network Participants.

## 6. Does it make a difference if I use Corda Enterprise or Corda Open Source on Corda Network? 

You can join Corda Network running either Corda Enterprise or Corda Open Source. Corda Enterprise offers additional features that are required for mission-critical enterprise applications, which includes enhanced performance, High Availability, HSM integration, Enterprise Database integration, advanced Support and more. There is no official R3 Production Support for Open Source Corda (you are entitled to Support for Corda-Network related queries only), however, you could ask questions and ask for solutions to your problems from the Corda Developer Community on Slack, StackOverflow and use other resources outlined in the table under Question 8.

## 7. What do you need to join Corda Network?

Before joining Corda Network, would-be Participants should make sure to go through the list of [pre-requisites](https://corda.network/joining-corda-network/pre-requisites). 

## 8. Are there fees to participate in Corda Network?

Yes, there are annual fees for node identities and for transactions. Prices will vary depending on the number of nodes and volume of transactions you plan to make. Please contact your R3 Account Eexecutive or reach out via the [Contact Us](https://corda.network/contact/contact-us) form to discuss your requirements.
