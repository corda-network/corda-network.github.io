## Advisory Governance Event: #1 | 07 May 2019

**Proposal**
Converge the UAT Network (or sometimes known as “Pre-Production” Network) to be part of the Corda Network Foundation’s overall remit. For more details, please see here: https://uat.network.r3.com/

**Rationale**
Most, if not all, of Corda Network customers will be joining both Pre-Production and Production. 
Bringing both networks under the same remit and governance will make the overall customer onboarding and ongoing experience much smoother, in terms of there being 
-	1 legal agreement
-	1 streamlined price for both UAT and Production as well as from a billing and data management perspective.

We also expect that customers can join just once (in UAT) and not have to re-onboard onto Production. 

**Conclusion**
Stakeholders in R3 (Product and Production teams as well as Legal and Finance) as well as the Transition Board of the Corda Network Foundation are unanimously agreed. 

**Decision** 
The decision has been taken to merge UAT into the remit of Corda Network Foundation. The transition is now underway.
