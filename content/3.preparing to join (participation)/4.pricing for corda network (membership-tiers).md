# Pricing

## 1. Annual Participation Fee

In general, the term 'participation' rather than 'membership' is used, as this is the terminology used for a Dutch Stichting in the laws governing it. At present, participation in Corda Network is for legal entities only. The invoice is sent directly to Direct Participant and Sponsors, and managed by Sponsors for Sponsee participants.

### Participation Certificate

* Receives full onboarding support onto Corda Network from the Network Operator
* Can be a member of multiple business networks and run multiple business applications
* Has voting rights for how the Foundation is governed
* Can stand for the Foundation's Board of Directors

Pricing: Free until December 2021.

## 2. Transaction Fees

Transaction fees are charged for notarisation provided by [Corda Network notary](/participation/notary-considerations), and are structured in two different models. 

Both apply on a per-identity basis:

### Model 1. Pay As You Go

This is invoiced retrospectively at the end of the year. As with participation fees, the invoice is managed by Sponsors 
for identity-only participants, and sent direct to full members.

| Number of transactions per year |      Cost $ |
|---------------------------------|------------:|
| 0 â€“ 10K                         |        FREE |
| 10 - 20K                        | 10c per txn |
| 20K +                           |  1c per txn | 

### Model 2. Up-front Package

This is designed to provide assurance over notarisation costs. It is invoiced prospectively at the start of the year. 
As with participation fees, the invoice is managed by Sponsors for identity-only participants.

| Number of transactions per year | Cost $ |
|---------------------------------|-------:|
| 0 - 50K                         | $1,000 |
| 50 - 100K                       |   $800 |
| 100K +,(in 50k increments)      |   $500 | 

Any 'unused' transactions at the year-end are not carried forwards or reimbursed. Additional transaction 
packages can be purchased at any time, but previous purchases that year are ignored in calculating the cost.

## 3. (Optional) Segregated Networks

The annual fee for a segregated network in both Pre-Production and Production is $10,000 per year. This includes us running a network map and a certificate issuance service. You must run your own notary in a segregated network. 

## Third-party Notaries

Notary fees for third-party notaries are at the sole discretion of the corresponding notary provider, and invoicing is managed by them. There are no Corda Network fees for running your own notary. See [Notary Considerations](/participation/notary-considerations).
