## Revised Participation Pricing

### Proposal

Reduce the participation fee to zero until the end of 2021 (3 years), and thereafter have a single participation fee of 
$1000 per node per year. The current pricing is for Full membership: $2500 per node and for Identity-only: $100.

### Reason

To stimulate adoption of the network. Having a joining fee causes friction, causing some 
potential users to not join. At this stage, when Corda Network could be a differentiator 
for our success, perhaps we cannot afford this. Most participants are choosing the 
identity-only tier resulting in them not taking part in governance + only in 
one business network. This will not help the Networkâ€™s development. Many clients are 
joining Segregated Sub-Zones in the near-term, but there is no 
separate price for this. This should be re-considered.


### Impact

High. This will require a greater draw-down on the Foundation's commercial loan. 

### Decision

Unanimously approved by a vote.
