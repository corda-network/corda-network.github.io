# Business Networks (Consortiums)

For Corda, Business Networks are groups of companies who wish to transact together - using either Corda Open Source or Enterprise, for a specific commercial purpose. 

**Governance**

Business Networks can have many different governance models. Business Networks using Corda can range from a consortium model, to a more centralized model with a Business Network Operator (which may be a separate legal entity). A Business Network Operator often sets-up and operates legal rules, organisation structure and business processes for its Business Network. They may also design and operate a shared CorDapp for the Business Network’s members to transact with, or this can also be set-up and run by a third party. In most circumstances, a Business Network Operator should ask its participants to sign legal agreements directly with R3 (prior to joining the Network), except when the Business Network Operator has established a sponsorship model with R3.


**Business Network Membership Management**

Business Networks are an abstraction layer on top of Corda Network, that provide some of the benefits of separate, private networks, such as control over membership, while at the same time enabling cross Business Network transactions, all operating within the same zone: Corda Network.

We continue to develop tools and features for Business Networks to work well. For more information on the options and flexibility which Business Networks can offer while using Corda please visit [Business networks and memberships](https://github.com/corda/bn-extension) and [Corda solutions site](https://solutions.corda.net/business-networks/intro.html).

**Corda Network Community**

A vibrant network of application builders, Business Network Operators and participants make up the Corda Network. Multi-party applications built on Corda, R3’s scalable, permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) app development platform, enable network participants to seamlessly transact with one another.
