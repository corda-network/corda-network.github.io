**About Corda Network**

Corda Network Foundation is a non-profit organisation that governs the Corda Network. Corda Network allows for the transfer of data and digital assets between communities of nodes (business networks) and different CorDapps. Participants can therefore create private ecosystems within their organisation, or with trusted commercial partners, while remaining interoperable with the wider Corda community where appropriate. Relevant information can be shared between applications and organisations without the need for intermediaries, creating efficiencies and avoiding duplication. Corda Network also includes identity verification and privacy services to ensure that participants can operate on the network safely.

(For information about how to onboard a node, please refer to the [Onboarding Workflow](https://corda.network/joining-corda-network/onboarding-workflow).)

- Such node is an "eligible node", which gives the legal entity that owns the node the right to 1) vote for and 2) stand for the Board.

- The owner of the node identity is listed on the Organisation (“O”) field of the node’s x500 certificate. 

- Whether the legal entity owning the node is a direct customer of Corda Network (signed a Corda Network contract with R3) or a sponsee (covered by their Sponsor’s Corda Network contract with R3), are not relevant.

**2. Nominate up to 3 individuals**

This is by design to enable a staggered board, according to Section 3.3 of the [Foundation's By-Laws](https://corda.network/corda-network-foundation/by-laws)

(*A live node means that the node appears on the network map of the Corda Network Production enviornment published by R3’s Corda Network.)

### 1 April 2021

**Corda Network operations now run by R3** 

The day to day running of Corda Network services will be managed by R3 as of April 2021. 

The Foundation will continue as the governing body of the Network, but will no longer have contractual relationships with Corda Network Participants. Its key role remains to safeguard the Corda Network Trust Root, set identity standards for participants and oversee that R3 runs the Network in line with requirements set out in the Certificate Policy. More details about the roles and responsibilities can be found in [*About the Foundation*](https://corda.network/corda-network-foundation/about-the-foundation).

Please have a browse through our updated website and check out the newly published [*Corda Network Rulebook*](https://corda.network/corda-network-rulebook/introduction), [*SLA & Maintenance Handbook*](https://corda.network/trust-centre/sla-&-maintenance-handbook) and [*Support Handbook*](https://corda.network/support/corda-network-support-service-handbook).  


### 27 January 2021

**Update to Corda Network CRL** 


As of 8 February 2021 the Corda Network’s CRL will be served from an Azure CDN endpoint in order to continue to improve both resiliency and availability of Corda Network. Note that Corda Network’s CRL will only be available from the published CRL endpoint i.e. **crl.corda.network**

Please ensure that your Corda nodes are able to connect to Azure CDN endpoints or that connectivity to Azure CDN is not blocked by your Network Administrator by 8 February 2021.

- About Azure CDN:
  - Azure CDN endpoints are everywhere around the globe (Point of Presence/POP). It’s not a unique IP, rather a list of IPs.
  - Azure CDN uses the following FQDNs in order to retrieve the final destination IP (DNS A Record).
      - *.azureedge.net
      - *.trafficmanager.net
      - *.msedge.net
  - Ensure the destinations above are not blocked to access the CRL in the destination IP (DNS A Record)
  
- Your connection to CRL should not be disrupted if outbound connectivity to TCP port 80 in not blocked. Check that the node can reach the DNS “crl.corda.network“, or whitelist the DNS entry for “crl.corda.network” in your firewall.

- Ensure you have not IP whitelisted the current CRL endpoint (i.e. Doorman).
 

For more information please email info@corda.network.



### 18 August 2020

**Corda Network Statuspage is moving** 


As of 2 September 2020, all Corda Network infrastructure maintenance and incident related announcements will be communicated via a new password-protected site at https://corda-network.statuspage.io/. Current Statuspage at https://cordanetwork.statuspage.io/ will be decommissioned as part of this development. 

We are making these changes in order to deliver enhanced and more private communications around Corda Network infrastructure.

All participants on Corda Pre-Production and Production Networks will receive a prompt from Statuspage to their node operator email address, asking to complete registration and create log in details to access the portal and receive automatic updates.

Failure to complete registration means that you will no longer receive maintenance & incident-related updates.

Please contact info@corda.network by Friday 28 August 2020 if you wish to register any additional subscribers from your (or your sponsee’s) organisation to use the new Statuspage.

For more information please email info@corda.network.
