# Community

Corda Network expects to hold all discussions in public. Join cordaledger.slack.com and please tag @jamescarlyle, @Elfreda, @Kadri Siff or @caroquinn there or join #corda-network. We also have a [Corda Network mailing list](https://groups.io/g/corda-network), where we debate policy changes, and attempt to support 
the community by helping each other with questions and answers.

We also meet face to face (when able to!) at [Corda meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/corda/), especially in 
[London](https://www.meetup.com/London-Corda-Meetup/).
