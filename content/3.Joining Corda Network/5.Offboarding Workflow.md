If you foresee that one or some of your Corda Network network certificate(s) will not be used permanently or will not re-join in the long-run, you may submit a request to revoke the certificate.
If you do not intend for the network certificate to be dormant permanently but want to hide the node from the network map, you may shut down the node and it will be hidden from the network map, and once you restart the node it will show up on the network map automatically. You can read more about this feature *(**eventHorizon**)* on the [Corda Documentation Site](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-enterprise/4.8/network/network-reqs.html#corda-network-parameters).

If you wish to permanently leave Corda Network, you can terminate your Corda Network contract. All your network certificates will be automatically revoked. Please speak to your R3 Account Manager if that is the case.

Here are the steps you need to take if you want to request revocation of one of your network certificates without terminating your Corda Network agreement.

**Step 1: Raise a Support ticket**

Submit a [Task](https://r3-cev.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/52/create/116) ticket on the Corda Network Support Portal, following the below instructions. PLEASE SUBMIT ONE REQUEST PER CERTIFICATE TO BE REVOKED. You should submit multiple requests if you need to revoke more than one certificate.

1. **Summary**: Input "Certificate Revocation Request"
2. **Description** (All of the below information are MANDATORY):

- **X.500 Name**:
- **Business Reason** for revoking the certificte: *(As certificate revocation is a **irreversible** process, please ensure that you have fully considered the consequeneces before submitting a revocation request. The business reason will be reviewed and prioritised by R3. Acceptable business reasons include: Change of legal entity name, Private key compromised, Lost of certificate, or other business reasons that cannot be achieved without revoking the node's certificate.)*
- **Original CSR Request ID**:
- **Attachment**: *(Certificate revocation should be approved in writing by two officers (usually director or above) of the legal owner of the certificate. If the certificate belongs to your entity, attach email approvals from two directors (or above) from your company; If the certificate belongs to a sponsee entity of you, attach one email approval from a director (or above) of your company and one email approval from a director (or above) of the sponsee's entity.)*

**Step 2: Confirmation**

The revocation may take a few days or weeks to process. Once the revocation is complete, our Support Engineer will inform you on the ticket that it is done.
