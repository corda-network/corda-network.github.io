# Contracting Model

To be a participant of Corda Network, you first need to sign a Corda Network Participant Terms of Use. There are two contracting models for you to choose from, depending on whether you are a user of a Corda application or are running a Corda application.

If you are a Corda application user, or running a Corda application with most of the potential users already on Corda Network, the Corda Network **Intergroup Sponsoring Participant** Terms of Use will be more suitable for you, meaning you take responsibility for paying any of the Network’s low billing costs, and interact with R3 for support and queries.

If you are using a Corda application that provides sponsorship on Corda Network, you can avoid signing the Corda Network Terms of Use with R3. Discuss with your application's contact to explore if joining Corda Network as a sponsee is an option.

If you are building and/or running a Corda application, you may want to go for the Corda Network **Sponsoring Participant** Terms of Use, which will cover you and any other entities within or outside of your group company to join Corda Network. You will take on responsibility to manage their nodes’ behaviour on the network and pay their Corda Network fees and submit requests for network identities to R3 on their behalf. We recommend that you have a contract sign with these entities as part of the Terms of Use of your Corda application.
