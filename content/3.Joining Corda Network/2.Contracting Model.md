# Join Directly or as a Sponsor

To be a participant of Corda Network, you first need to sign a Corda Network Participant Terms of Use. There are two contracting models for you to choose from, depending on whether you are a user of a Corda application or are running a Corda application.

If you are a Corda application user, or running a Corda application with most of the potential users already on Corda Network, the Corda Network **Intergroup Sponsoring Participant** Terms of Use will be more suitable for you, meaning you take responsibility for paying any of the Network’s low billing costs, and interact with R3 for support and queries.

There is also an option to join as an **Intergroup Sponsoring Participant** if you intend to have multiple legal entities within your organisation to join the network, which means you take on responsibility for their nodes’ behaviour on the network (but their onboarding process will be completely controlled by you) and look after all billing and identity checks for them.
