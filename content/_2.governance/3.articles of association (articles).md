  includes coordinating with the open source project wherein the Corda protocol is currently specified (the "Open Source
  Project") and accepting evolutions of the Corda protocol;
- to achieve the vision of Corda as defined in any platform and technical whitepapers;
- to promote the ubiquity and utility of Corda throughout all applicable industries and commercial use cases;
- to commission the provision and operation of infrastructure and services for the Network, both of technical services,
  and infrastructure needed for meetings, events and collaborative discussions, and provide structure around the business
  and technical governance of the Network;
- to set minimum standards for the provision of notary services;
- to curate a diverse and vibrant community of industry experts, Corda contributors, users and services, including
  developers, service and solution providers and end users;
- to balance the divergent interests of a wide range of stakeholders, including business network operators, Corda
  customers and open source developers;
- to set up any advisory committees in relation to the Network to assist the board in such matters as the board may
  request;
- to supervise and monitor any Network operator's (the "Operator") performance to ensure that the Network operates in
  an effective, efficient and ethical manner;
- to hold the Network's Trust Root to be employed for creation of operational certificates independently from the
  Operator; and
- to enter into any agreements in relation to any of the matters mentioned above, including but not limited to the
  Participant Terms of Use (as defined in clause 8.1 herein);

9.1 The Foundation (including its successors and assigns) shall indemnify any person (including by paying the fees and
expenses of the director's attorney directly to such adviser) who is or was a director and who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Foundation) by reason of the
fact that he/she is or was a director of the Foundation (an "indemnified person") against all expenses (including
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by him/her in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he/she acted in good faith and in a manner he/she reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Foundation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no cause to believe his/her conduct was unlawful or outside of his/her mandate (nor should have had such
cause to believe, having made all reasonable enquiries as would be expected of a director acting in compliance with all
applicable laws, codes of conducts and best industry practices). The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by a
judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,
create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and not in a manner which he/she reasonably could believe
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Foundation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had reasonable cause to believe that his/her conduct was unlawful.
For the purposes of clause 9.1, prior to agreeing to settlement and/or fronting any amounts in respect of third-party
claims, the relevant director shall (i) notify the Foundation of such claim immediately upon becoming aware of such
claim; (ii) consult with the Foundation to obtain the Foundation's consent to the terms of such settlement (unless such
consultation is prohibited by law); (iii) take all reasonable steps to limit any such expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgements, fines and amounts paid in settlement, and (iv) use best endeavours to agree that a term of any such
settlement will be the absolving of the Foundation from any and all further liability arising out of or in connection
with such settled claim.  
9.2 An indemnified person shall not be entitled to any indemnification as mentioned in clause 9.1 as far as the
indemnified person has gained personal profit, benefits or remuneration to which he/she was not entitled, or in case the
indemnified person has acted through fraud, wilful misconduct, gross negligence or breached their duties under
applicable law as determined by the court in a final and binding judgment.  
9.3 Any indemnification by the Foundation referred to in clauses 9.1 and 9.2, shall (unless ordered by a court) only
be made by the Foundation upon a determination by the Foundation that indemnification of the director is proper under
the circumstances because he / she had met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in clauses 9.1 and 9.2 and all
applicable laws.  
9.4 The indemnification provided for by this article 9 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to which an
indemnified person may be entitled under the laws of the Netherlands, as from time to time amended or under any by-laws,
agreement, resolution of the general meeting or otherwise, both as to actions in his/her official capacity and as to
actions in another capacity while holding such position, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director and shall also inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and the estate of an indemnified
person.

resolution to dissolve the Foundation is passed. The surplus shall be divided pro rata to the contribution paid by each
