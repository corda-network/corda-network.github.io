# Full Privacy Statement

Corda Network respects your concerns about privacy and values the
relationship we have with you. This Privacy Statement describes the
types of information we collect about you, how we collect, use and
retain your information, with whom we share it, how we protect your
information, the choices available to you regarding our use of the
information, and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.

It is important that you read this **Privacy Statement** together with
any other fair processing **policies or notices** we may provide on
specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data
about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your
data. This **Privacy Statement** supplements other policies and notices
and is not intended to override them.

## 1. What Information Does This Privacy Statement Apply to?

This Privacy Statement applies to the collection, use, disclosure and
retention of information from and about you by Corda Foundation on
https://corda.network/, through email communications, and through other
sources. This Privacy Statement does not apply to other websites which
may be accessible through hyperlinks on the website.

While this website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins
and applications, linking to a third-party site does not necessarily
mean that we endorse the site, any products or services described on the
site, or any other material contained in a third-party site. To the
extent any linked websites you visit are not owned or controlled by us,
we are not responsible for the sites' content, any use of the sites, or
the privacy practices of the sites. Clicking on those links or
enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share
data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not
responsible for their privacy statements, so please review the privacy
statement on those other websites to see how they handle your
information.

If you choose to use our Website in any way, such as browsing or
interacting, you agree with the terms of our current Privacy Statement
as posted here. If you do not agree with this Privacy Statement, you
should not use our Website. We may update or modify this Privacy
Statement from time to time at our sole discretion, and will note the
date of last update on the top of this page. We encourage you to visit
this area frequently to stay informed, as your continued use of our
website following the posting of changes to these terms means that you
consent to such changes. It is also important that the information we
hold about you is accurate and current. Please therefore keep us
informed if your information changes during your relationship with us.

## 2.What Information Does Corda Network Collect? 

Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an
individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include
data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal
data about you which we have grouped together as follows:

1.  **Identity Data** includes first name, maiden name, last name,
    username or similar identifier, company, title,

2.  **Contact Data** includes email address and telephone numbers.


3.  **Technical Data** includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login
    data, browser type and version, Media Access Control address,
    time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and
    versions, operating system and platform, device information, domain,
    webpage address that linked you to our Website, pages visited, and
    whether you have visited us before or are new to the Website

4.  **Usage Data includes** information about how you use our website,
    products and services.

5.  **Marketing and Communications** Data includes your preferences in
    receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your
    communication preferences.

We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or
demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data could be derived from
your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this
data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example,
we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users
accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect
Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or
indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data
which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you
(this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or
philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions,
trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and
biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal
convictions and offences.

## 3. How is your Information Collected?

We may obtain information about you from various sources. We may collect
this information when you provide it on our website, in telephone or
email communication, through third parties (such as when you provide
employment application information to a third party), or at one of our
events. When you visit the website, we may also collect certain
information about your device or usage by automated means or by using
technologies such as cookies, web server logs, and web beacons, as
described below.

Information that You or Others Provide

You may choose to provide information (such as Identity Data or Contact
Data) to us when you correspond with us by filling in forms, post,
phone, email or otherwise.

If you provide us with information regarding another individual, we will
assume that you have that person's consent to give us his or her
information.

Information Collected Automatically

When you visit this website or open an email that we send you, we may
collect **Technical** **Data** and **Usage Data** about your equipment,
browsing actions and patterns by automated means or by using
technologies such as cookies, web server logs, and web beacons, as well
as other web-based technologies.

-   **Cookies**: Cookies are small text files that websites
    send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely
    identify your browser or to store information or settings in your
    browser. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you
    receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable
    certain cookies. Some cookies may exist for only a single session
    and some are persistent for multiple sessions over time. We may use
    cookies that are managed by Corda Network or by third parties for
    the purposes provided in this Privacy Statement, including for
    session management, authentication, user preference storage, website
    performance and personalization, Website analytics, content
    management, search, and social media integration.

-   **Web server logs**: In conjunction with obtaining
    information through cookies, our web servers may log details
    regarding your device, operating system, or information about your
    Website usage.

-   **Web beacons & pixel** to control which web servers
    collect information described above, we may place tags on our 
    Website or in emails called "web beacons" or "pixels." These are
    computer instructions that link web pages to particular web servers
    and their cookies. Web beacons and pixels can be used to track the
    pages you view, links that you click, or other online behavior.
    These tools may also be used to measure the effectiveness of our
    email campaigns by identifying the individuals who open or act upon
    an email message, when an email message is opened, how many times an
    email message is forwarded, the type of software, device, operating
    system and browser used to deliver the email, and any URL accessed
    through our email message.

-   **Other**: we may use other technology to collect
    information for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement.

At this time, we do not honor "do not track" signals from website
browsers. However, you may refuse or delete cookies. If you refuse or
delete cookies, some of the functionality of our websites may be
impaired. If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies
will still detect visits to our websites, but the information they
generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie
information and are disregarded. Please refer to your browser Help
instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of
similar technologies.

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we
collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new
purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will
notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your
knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is
required or permitted by law.

Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we
are relying on to process your **personal data** where more than one
ground has been identified.

## 5. How Does Corda Network Share My Information? 

We may disclose your information to third parties who help us maintain
our website or sales and marketing efforts. Examples of these service
providers include entities that provide web hosting or analytics
services. These service providers may be located around the world and in
countries where privacy rules are different or less stringent than rules
in the country where you reside.

We may also contract with third-party advertising networks that
collect IP addresses and other information through the use of cookies,
web server logs and web beacons on our Websites and emails; on
third-party websites and emails; and on our advertising placed on
third-party websites. They use this information to provide
advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests
(including for companies not affiliated with us). You may see these
advertisements on other websites. This process also helps us manage and
track the effectiveness of our and third-party marketing efforts.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal
data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our
third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own
purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for
specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

In addition, we may share your information if necessary to protect the
safety, property, or other rights of us, our customers, or employees, or
when otherwise required by law. We may also share your information with
your consent in certain circumstances.

Your information may be stored in databases maintained by Corda Network
(including local storage) or third parties, and may be disclosed to
third parties for the purposes stated in this Privacy Statement, that
are located within and outside the United States, including countries
where privacy rules differ and may be less stringent than those of the
country in which you reside.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure that
a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least
one of the following safeguards is implemented:

-   We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have
    been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal
    data by the European Commission. For further details, see
    [*European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data
    in non-EU
    countries*](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en).

-   Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
    contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal
    data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details,
    see [*European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of
    personal data to third
    countries*](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en).

**Please contact us if you want further information on the specific
mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the
EEA.**

## 6. Is My Information Secure?

Corda Network will take reasonable precautions and put in place
appropriate security measures to protect your information from loss and
unauthorized access, misuse, alteration or disclosure. In addition, we
limit access to your information to those employees, agents, contractors
and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only
process your information on our instructions and they are subject to a
duty of confidentiality. Please be aware, however, that any email or
other transmission you send through the Internet cannot be completely
protected against unauthorized interception.

We have also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected
**personal data** breach and will notify you and any applicable
regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## 7. What Choices Do I Have?

We only store data for as long as it is reasonably necessary to fulfil
the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting
requirements.

We may retain your **personal data** for a longer period in the event of
a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of
litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

## 8. What About my Rights under GDPR?

As an EU Citizen, the processing of your personal information is subject
to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), and you
therefore have the following rights:

-   Right of access -- you have the right to request a copy of the data
    that we hold about you.

-   Right of rectification -- you have a right to correct data that we
    hold about you that is inaccurate or incomplete.

-   Right to be forgotten -- you can ask for the data we hold about you
    to be erased from our records.

-   Right to restriction of processing -- you can ask for us to restrict
    the way we process your data.

-   Right of portability -- you have the right to have the data we hold
    about you transferred to another organisation.

-   Right to object -- you have the right to object to our processing
    your data where we are relying on a legitimate interest in order to
    process it.

-   Right to withdraw your consent -- you have the right to withdraw
    your consent at any time.

Please note that these rights are not absolute and certain exemptions
apply. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please
contact us.

Corda Network is committed to working with you to obtain a fair and
rapid resolution of any queries, complaints, or disputes about privacy.
