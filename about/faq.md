### My legal entity wants to be a member of more than one business network. Should I use only one node (the same node) in each one BN?

You can use the same node OR different nodes in each one. This should be a decision your business makes, but Corda allows for either.

---

### I’m interested for several legal entities within my Corporate Group to join Corda Network, via several nodes. Do they all have to sign legal agreements?

You can sign a Corporate Sponsor agreement which covers access for all for them. This needs to be signed by an authorised signatory from one legal entity.

---

### If I have a third party hosting a node on my behalf, do you provide a template legal agreement for that?

No. This is strictly between your legal entity and that 3rd party, and is separate from any legal relationship you have with Corda Network. We are agnostic who hosts the node.

---

### Do you negotiate on the legal agreements provided in this website?

No. These are standard agreements. The Foundation is a not for profit, which doesn’t have the resources to negotiate.

---

### If I have a Sponsored Node on the Network, but now want to join another Business Network, how do I change my membership type?

Email info@corda.network. We will be introducing web functionality later to help do this.

---

### Can a Business Network have both sponsored and direct participants ?

Yes.

---

## Segregated Networks

### If I have a node on a Segregated Network, can I transact with the mainnet?

No. For this to happen, the node and notary on the Segregated Network must merge with the mainnet.

---

### Can the Foundation run a notary for me, on the mainnet?

No. If you join a Segregated Network, you’ll need to set-up and run your own notary (either a cluster of nodes or one node). 

---

### Who makes the decision about joining a Segregated Network, or mainnet?

Typically this will be the Business Network Operator who decides, but usually in consultation with their end-participants.

---

## Notary

### What kind of notary does the network have?

It is a highly-available, non-validating notary. For more information about what a notary is, see this website. 

---

### Is there a plan to introduce more notaries?

Yes – Corda supports more than one notary. At the moment (Dec 2019) there is only one notary, but we do want other notaries including run by third parties, in the future.

---

## Other

### Does it make a difference if I use Corda Enterprise or Corda Open Source, on Corda Network?

No.

### I’m not an Enterprise customer. Am I still entitled to Support?

Yes, we have some support available for customers on network-related issues. We will be publishing the Handbook soon, but for now, please email info@corda.network.
