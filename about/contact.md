# Community

Corda Network Foundation expects to hold all discussions in public. Our community is centred around the 
[Corda Network mailing list](https://groups.io/g/corda-network), where we debate policy changes, and attempt to support 
the community by helping each other with questions and answers.

We also meet face to face frequently at [Corda meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/corda/), especially in 
[London](https://www.meetup.com/London-Corda-Meetup/). And we are happy to help on the Corda Network Slack channel - join cordaledger.slack.com and please tag @jamescarlyle or @caroquinn there or join #corda-network
