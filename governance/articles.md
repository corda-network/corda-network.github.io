Informal translation in the English language of the substance of the original notarial deed of incorporation of Corda 
Network Foundation Stichting in the Dutch language. In this translation an attempt has been made to be as literal as 
possible, without jeopardising the overall continuity. Inevitably, differences may occur in the translation, and if so, 
the Dutch text will govern.

developers, service and solution providers and end users;

### 9.	INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS

9.1	The Foundation (including its successors and assigns) shall indemnify any person (including by paying the fees and 
expenses of the director's attorney directly to such adviser) who is or was a director and who was or is a party or is 
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, 
criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Foundation) by reason of the 
fact that he/she is or was a director of the Foundation (an "indemnified person") against all expenses (including 
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by him/her in 
connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he/she acted in good faith and in a manner he/she reasonably 
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Foundation, and, with respect to any criminal action or 
proceeding, had no cause to believe his/her conduct was unlawful or outside of his/her mandate (nor should have had such 
cause to believe, having made all reasonable enquiries as would be expected of a director acting in compliance with all 
applicable laws, codes of conducts and best industry practices). The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by a 
judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, 
create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and not in a manner which he/she reasonably could believe 
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Foundation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, 
had reasonable cause to believe that his/her conduct was unlawful.	
For the purposes of clause  9.1, prior to agreeing to settlement and/or fronting any amounts in respect of third-party 
claims, the relevant director shall (i) notify the Foundation of such claim immediately upon becoming aware of such 
claim; (ii) consult with the Foundation to obtain the Foundation's consent to the terms of such settlement (unless such 
consultation is prohibited by law); (iii) take all reasonable steps to limit any such expenses (including attorneys' 
fees), judgements, fines and amounts paid in settlement, and (iv) use best endeavours to agree that a term of any such 
settlement will be the absolving of the Foundation from any and all further liability arising out of or in connection 
with such settled claim.  
9.2	An indemnified person shall not be entitled to any indemnification as mentioned in clause  9.1 as far as the 
indemnified person has gained personal profit, benefits or remuneration to which he/she was not entitled, or in case the 
indemnified person has acted through fraud, wilful misconduct, gross negligence or breached their duties under 
applicable law as determined by the court in a final and binding judgment.  
9.3	Any indemnification by the Foundation referred to in clauses  9.1 and 9.2, shall (unless ordered by a court) only 
be made by the Foundation upon a determination by the Foundation that indemnification of the director is proper under 
the circumstances because he / she had met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in clauses  9.1 and 9.2 and all 
applicable laws.  
9.4	The indemnification provided for by this article 9 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to which an 
indemnified person may be entitled under the laws of the Netherlands, as from time to time amended or under any by-laws, 
agreement, resolution of the general meeting or otherwise, both as to actions in his/her official capacity and as to 
actions in another capacity while holding such position, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a 
director and shall also inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and the estate of an indemnified 
person.

its rights and obligations can be ascertained at any time.
